            <h2>Inspiration Gathering</h2>

            <img class='fill-image' src='images/inspo_wall.png'>

            <p class='small_content'>I initially wanted to create a website to refresh my skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript but also because there's 
                just so much to people than a single page of information. I wanted to humanize the process of getting to know me just a little bit.
            </p>

            <p class='small_content'>
                For the overall aesthetics, I wanted to reflect a relaxed, calmer vibe that reflects a lot of the music that I listen to. The flower 
                headers and nature aspects were largely inspired by a music mega mix video that had a lot of hard cuts of nature scenes. 
            </p>

            <div class='medium_content'>
                <p>
                    Here is a list of the goals that I set out for myself before building this page:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create a website that represents me</li>
                    <li>Convey story and user interaction through movement. Website should be intuitive as most UI should be (like gaming menus)</li>
                    <li>Learn how to be inspired by others works (music, magazine layouts, other websites, gaming, etc)</li>
                    <li>Complete full track of ideation to implementation</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class='content'>
            <h2>Wireframing</h2>
            <p class='small_content'>In order to map out how I wanted the website to look, I created low-fidelity wireframes and mock-ups for each page to guide me during 
                the implementation process. To save time for myself, I chose to opt out of creating a super detailed prototype but in a more real development 
                environment, it would be important to convey more detail to communicate ideas better.
            </p>
            <p class='small_content'>
                <span class='strong'>Low-fidelity wireframe</span>: a sketch of simple boxes and text to convey the basic concepts, layout, and functionality
                 to be shown on the screen. 
            </p>

            <p class='small_content'>
                <span class='strong'>Mock-ups</span>: An image that builds off initial wireframes to portray colors, fonts, images, and other styling details.
                 This should portray how the final product will look.
            </p>

            <p class='small_content'>
                <span class='strong'>Prototype</span>: An interactive simulation that demonstrates how different elements of a website interact with one another
                 and how smooth the navigation experience will be.

                <p class='small_content'>
                    One way designers can strive to keep tech accessible is through color. Websites should pass the web accessibility color contrast ratio suggested by WCAG2.2. In addition, 
                    designers should simulate color blindness filters on their designs to better understand how others may view their work.

                <h2>Building & Deploying</h2>
                <p class='small_content'>
                    Once the design phase was finished, it was time to move onto the development stage. I spent a couple of days refreshing my knowledge on HTML, CSS, and Javascript through reading 
                    guides, such as <a class='dark-link' href='https://internetingishard.netlify.app/'>Interneting is Hard</a> and MDN docs, and working through small examples. After gaining more confidence I dove right into building this project since learning is best done by just doing. 
                </p>

                <p class='small_content'>Everything on this website was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The website was built in VSCode and deployed on Github.</p>
            </div>
       

            <div class='content'>
                <h2>Reflections & Next Steps</h2>

                <p>Overall, creating this whole project was a valuable learning experience. Going through the motions of designing a website to deploying a fully interactable version was a process full of learning, adjusting, and trying.</p>

                <p>What did I learn? What would I do differently?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class='strong'>Better workflow</span>: I would definitely spend a lot more time fleshing out the website design better before jumping into development. I got a little too excited jumping into developing that I had to constantly readjust and re-implement things due to poor design planning.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class='strong'>Inspiration from others</span>: I learned that simply just viewing other websites and trying to picture what it took to implement it sections at a time is a great way to get inspiration and a visual representation of your end goal. The world is really your oyster.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>So, what's next?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class='strong'>Backend Projects</span>: One thing I plan to include is a small project I'm working on where Spotify users who visit the page can compare how similar their music tastes are to mine.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class='strong'>Responsive Design</span>: The website is painfully lacking responsive design, which means it won't display equally well on smaller screens and currently works best when viewed in full screen browser on a monitor. It would be nice to create a overall better viewing experience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class='strong'>Constant Improvement</span>: I hope to improve and study the interaction of frontend and backend by creating more projects and analyzing the work of others.
                    </li>
                </ul>
