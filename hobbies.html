                    <p class='small_content'>Drawing and character designing are my favorite pastimes. Did you know that everything in the world can just be broken down into simpler shapes
                        to get a better understanding of its form? Through that fundamental truth, I find that drawing and the problem solving you see in software engineering 
                        complement each other very well. By breaking things down to get a better understanding, you can create complex solutions and products in both worlds. Who knew STEM and the 
                        arts could be so similar?</p>

                        <p class='small_content'>Sometimes I like taking my creativity outside of the 2D realm and into the 3D. With the power of polymer clay and a strong childhood imagination, I used 
                            to spend a lot of time making my own character figusrines and making up little stories for them as a kid. These days, I use these skills to make custom keycaps
                            for myself and my friends. Though I don't do it as often as drawing, I find it nice work with my hands and translate my creative skills into the physical world. 
                            Crafting small figurines with clay may have fueled my modern day addiction to tiny trinkets that I litter my desktop with. But hey, if it 
                            sparks joy, I think its all worth it.

                <h2>Music</h2>

                <p class='small_content'>Music is such a core part of my every day life; I'm always bobbing my head to something no matter what I'm doing. When I need a boost of energy, 
                    I listen to a lot of EDM like melodic, hard trance, and dubstep. When I'm not listening to that, you can find me listening to more calm and ambient 
                    electropop, RnB, or pop. I love analyzing other people's music tastes and then curating playlists for them when they want to explore music genres I enjoy.

                        <p class='small_content'>Porter Robinson is my current favorite artist! On one hand, I love the bittersweet sense of nostalgia in his Nurture and Worlds albums. 
                            But on the otherhand, the sense of being grounded in appreciating the present and moving forward in Nurture motivates me to keep going.

                        <p>
                            There are so many songs I love from his discography but Something Comforting from Nurture and Sea of Voices from Worlds will always hold a special place in my heart.
                            When I'm feeling something more techno and trance, Angel Voices by Virtual Self, a side project by Porter Robinson, never fails to hit the spot.

                        <p class='small_content'>Island by Seven Lions, Trivecta, and Wooli is such a perfect blend of melodic EDM and aggressive dubstep, which showcases the range of EDM I've been exploring. 
                            The second drop goes so hard and I haven't been able to find a song that scratches the same itch.
