                        what better place to grow and challenge myself than in tech? I've made the most out of this period of my life and come back a much 
                        more motivated and stronger individual. I cannot wait to let my tenacity and curiosity shine through in the next things to come.

                                        <p>One easy way to start a conversation with me is to talk about music. I wanted to create a small application

                                            This would be done by utilizing the Spotify API. It's still a work in progress but it's coming along!
